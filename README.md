# ShopDatabaseController-WebAce-Project
***
### Local grocery store database control app
***
#### Requierments:
* Running Xampp (Apache, Mysql, Tomcat(not required))
* Existing "sklep" database in phpmyadmin (no further configuration of database needed)
* Project is made with Java 19.0.2
***
The latest available release should be working just fine!

What does a **Load Default** button do? It simply loads a premade sample of a grocery store database, for easier **UI and ADD, DELETE** check

Search is currently done **only through "NAZWA" field**, probably going to expand search capabilities in the future.
There is also no validation done in "Dodaj record" menu with mean **no error feedback when wrong values are given.**
Working on better error handling and feedback.
